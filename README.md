# Prototype Data Analytics Dashboard

This project is a prototype data analytics dashboard built with Streamlit. It aims to provide insights into the dataset by visualizing data through interactive charts and tables.

## Setup

To set up the project environment, you will need Python installed on your machine. Once Python is installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/rubythalib33/data-analytics-dashboard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd data-analytics-dashboard
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

After setting up the project environment, you can run the application using the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and your default web browser should automatically open to the application's URL, typically `http://localhost:8501`. You can interact with the dashboard through the web interface.
